Description:  create vpc with one public and private subnet.

#You can create a VPC that spans multiple Availability Zones. 
#After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. 
#Each subnet must reside exclusively within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.

#An Elastic IP address is a reserved public IP address that you can assign to any EC2 instance in a particular region, until you choose to release it
#A Public IP address associated with an instance is not static and is lost when the instance is stopped, 
#whereas an Elastic IP address is a static public address associated with your AWS account.
#Why is an Elastic IP Address required for NAT Gateway?
#It wouldn't make sense to have a dynamic address on a NAT device -- if the address changed, that would be guaranteed to break any sessions in progress... and the only way to allocate a static address is by allocating an Elastic IP address (EIP).
#It's also common to have external vendors whitelist your servers (for access to their servers) by providing them with the EIP of your NAT Gateway, in which case a dynamic address from the public pool would be unacceptable. 
#create elastic ip address.

#NAT Gateway, also known as Network Address Translation Gateway,
